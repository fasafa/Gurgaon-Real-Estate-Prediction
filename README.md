# Gurgaon Real Estate Prediction

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook is dedicated to analyzing and predicting real estate trends in Gurgaon. Using advanced data processing and visualization techniques, the notebook explores patterns in property listings, offering valuable insights for buyers, sellers, and investors.

## Dataset
The dataset gurgaon_10k.csv contains extensive real estate data from Gurgaon. Key features include:

Property Details: Area, location, and other specifics.

Pricing: Information on property prices.

Miscellaneous Data: Descriptions and links related to the properties.

Irrelevant columns such as IDS, URLS, DESCRIPTIONS, and IMAGES are removed during preprocessing to focus on meaningful data.

## Libraries Used
NumPy: For efficient numerical operations.
Pandas: To handle and manipulate large datasets.
Matplotlib: For static visualizations of trends and distributions.
Seaborn: To create insightful and attractive statistical plots.
Skleran :Preprocessing,ModelSelection etc.
Warnings: To suppress non-critical warnings for a cleaner workflow.

## Key Steps in the Notebook
#### Data Loading:
The dataset is read into a Pandas DataFrame using pd.read_csv().
Initial inspection of data structure and basic statistics.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Understanding the data through df.head(), df.info(), and df.describe().
Visualizing key columns to detect trends and anomalies.

##### Data Preprocessing:
Removal of irrelevant columns such as IDS, URLS, DESCRIPTIONS, and IMAGES.
Handling missing values to ensure a clean dataset.
Identifying and treating outliers using the IQR method for better model accuracy.

##### Data Visualization:
Creating distribution plots for prices and property areas.
Using scatterplots, heatmaps, and boxplots to explore relationships between variables.

##### Predictive Modeling:
 Building machine learning models to predict property prices based on features like location, area, and more.
